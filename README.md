### About

Its just some test about modularizing flutter app with separate packages that force making 
app's layers independent. 

#### Workspace

Dart's workspace works well with managing dependencies within app. It cause only one `pubspec.lock` file
is being generated.

#### Build runner

Generating code with build runner also seems to not be pain anymore. Just add `--workspace` parameter
to generate code for all workspace's packages.

- for app
```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

- for workspace
```bash
dart run build_runner build --workspace 
```
